or distribution of any and all Programs, Software, or Redistributables.

3. Restrictions.

classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination. 

The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, Using </installer/trunk/installer/miniroot> as the package base directory.

## Installing part 1 of 1.
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you. 

9. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and 
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 

10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 

11. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply. 

12. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification 
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
authorized representative of each party.

state.

EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you.

delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and

Common Public License Version 1.0

   THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
   PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
   THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
   
   1. DEFINITIONS 
   
   "Contribution" means:
   
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     
     i) changes to the Program, and
     
     ii) additions to the Program;
     
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
     such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
     which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
     conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
     (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
     
   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
   
   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
   which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
   alone or when combined with the Program.
   
   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.
   
   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
   Agreement, including all Contributors.
   
   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
   
     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
     display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
     works, in source code and object code form.
     
     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
     se is licensed hereunder.
     
     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
     rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
     assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
     
     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
     
   3. REQUIREMENTS
   
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
   under its own license agreement, provided that:
   
     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
     
     b) its license agreement:
     
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
     warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
     particular purpose;
     
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
     
     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
     and
     
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
     Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
     manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
     exchange.
     
   When the Program is made available in source code form:
   
     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
     
     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
     Program.
     
   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
   within the Program.
   
   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
   
   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
   responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
   like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
   of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
   commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
   create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
   Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
   such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
   against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
   from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
   against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
   or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
   distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
   obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
   relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
   notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
   allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
   claim at its own expense.
   
   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
   product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
   Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
   claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
   claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
   alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
   defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
   performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
   Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
   must pay those damages.
   
   5. NO WARRANTY
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
   PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
   OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
   distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
   exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
   the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
   laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.
   
   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
   ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
   WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
   DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   
   7. GENERAL
   
   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
   action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   
   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
   respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
   Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
   of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
   institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
   itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
   hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.
   
   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
   fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
   Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
   time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
   rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
   and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
   However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
   granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
   survive.
   
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
   but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
   may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
   reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
   this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
   Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
   Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
   Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
   the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
   Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
   the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
   after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
   elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
   the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
   above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
   property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
   by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
   
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
   the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
   party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
   more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
   its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

Common Public License Version 1.0

   THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
   PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
   THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
   
   1. DEFINITIONS 
   
   "Contribution" means:
   
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     
     i) changes to the Program, and
     
     ii) additions to the Program;
     
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
     such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
     which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
     conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
     (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
     
   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
   
   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
   which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
   alone or when combined with the Program.
   
   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.
   
   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
   Agreement, including all Contributors.
   
   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
   
     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
     display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
     works, in source code and object code form.
     
     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
     se is licensed hereunder.
     
     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
     rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
     assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
     
     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
     
   3. REQUIREMENTS
   
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
   under its own license agreement, provided that:
   
     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
     
     b) its license agreement:
     
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
     warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
     particular purpose;
     
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
     
     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
     and
     
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
     Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
     manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
     exchange.
     
   When the Program is made available in source code form:
   
     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
     
     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
     Program.
     
   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
   within the Program.
   
   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
   
   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
   responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
   like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
   of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
   commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
   create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
   Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
   such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
   against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
   from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
   against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
   or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
   distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
   obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
   relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
   notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
   allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
   claim at its own expense.
   
   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
   product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
   Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
   claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
   claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
   alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
   defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
   performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
   Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
   must pay those damages.
   
   5. NO WARRANTY
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
   PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
   OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
   distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
   exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
   the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
   laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.
   
   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
   ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
   WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
   DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   
   7. GENERAL
   
   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
   action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   
   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
   respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
   Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
   of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
   institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
   itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
   hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.
   
   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
   fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
   Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
   time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
   rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
   and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
   However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
   granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
   survive.
   
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
   but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
   may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
   reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
   this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
   Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
   Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
   Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
   the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
   Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
   the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
   after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
   elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
   the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
   above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
   property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
   by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
   
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
   the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
   party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
   more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
   its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and

the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination.

The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

8. Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
applicable to you.

9. Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,

the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its

and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

(i) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, 
logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this 
Agreement. 

(j) If your Permitted Use in this Agreement permits the distribution 
Software or portions of the Software, you may only distribute the Software 
subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent 
with the terms contained in this Agreement.

4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional 
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination. 

The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you. 

9. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with

acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply. 

12. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
