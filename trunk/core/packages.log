compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of

this distribution.

5. Term and Termination. 

The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, Using </installer/core/miniroot> as the package base directory.

## Installing part 1 of 1.
EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you. 

9. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.  
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and 
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 

10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 

11. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply. 

12. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification 
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
authorized representative of each party.

breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should

the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
state.

whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you.

and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and

Common Public License Version 1.0

   THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
   PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
   THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
   
   1. DEFINITIONS 
   
   "Contribution" means:
   
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     
     i) changes to the Program, and
     
     ii) additions to the Program;
     
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
     such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
     which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
     conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
     (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
     
   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
   
   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
   which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
   alone or when combined with the Program.
   
   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.
   
   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
   Agreement, including all Contributors.
   
   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
   
     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
     display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
     works, in source code and object code form.
     
     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
     se is licensed hereunder.
     
     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
     rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
     assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
     
     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
     
   3. REQUIREMENTS
   
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
   under its own license agreement, provided that:
   
     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
     
     b) its license agreement:
     
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
     warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
     particular purpose;
     
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
     
     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
     and
     
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
     Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
     manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
     exchange.
     
   When the Program is made available in source code form:
   
     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
     
     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
     Program.
     
   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
   within the Program.
   
   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
   
   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
   responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
   like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
   of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
   commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
   create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
   Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
   such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
   against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
   from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
   against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
   or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
   distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
   obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
   relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
   notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
   allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
   claim at its own expense.
   
   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
   product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
   Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
   claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
   claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
   alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
   defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
   performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
   Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
   must pay those damages.
   
   5. NO WARRANTY
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
   PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
   OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
   distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
   exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
   the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
   laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.
   
   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
   ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
   WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
   DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   
   7. GENERAL
   
   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
   action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   
   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
   respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
   Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
   of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
   institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
   itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
   hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.
   
   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
   fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
   Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
   time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
   rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
   and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
   However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
   granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
   survive.
   
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
   but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
   may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
   reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
   this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
   Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
   Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
   Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
   the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
   Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
   the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
   after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
   elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
   the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
   above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
   property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
   by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
   
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and

Common Public License Version 1.0

   THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
   PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
   THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
   
   1. DEFINITIONS 
   
   "Contribution" means:
   
     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
     
     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
     
     i) changes to the Program, and
     
     ii) additions to the Program;
     
     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
     and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
     'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
     such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
     behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
     which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
     conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
     (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
     
   "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
   
   "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
   which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
   alone or when combined with the Program.
   
   "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
   Agreement.
   
   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
   Agreement, including all Contributors.
   
   2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
   
     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
     display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
     Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
     works, in source code and object code form.
     
     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
     license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
     import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
     if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
     shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
     if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
     addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
     by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
     other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
     se is licensed hereunder.
     
     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
     licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
     provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
     patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
     Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
     brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
     property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
     rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
     assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
     property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
     patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
     Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
     before distributing the Program.
     
     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
     sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
     the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
     
   3. REQUIREMENTS
   
   A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
   under its own license agreement, provided that:
   
     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
     
     b) its license agreement:
     
     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
     warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
     particular purpose;
     
     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
     
     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
     are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
     and
     
     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
     Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
     manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
     exchange.
     
   When the Program is made available in source code form:
   
     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
     
     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
     Program.
     
   Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
   within the Program.
   
   Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
   Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
   Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
   
   4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
   
   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
   responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
   like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
   of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
   commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
   create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
   Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
   such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
   and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
   against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
   from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
   against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
   or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
   distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
   obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
   relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
   In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
   notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
   allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
   Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
   negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
   claim at its own expense.
   
   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
   product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
   Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
   claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
   claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
   alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
   defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
   performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
   Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
   must pay those damages.
   
   5. NO WARRANTY
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
   PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
   OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
   distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
   exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
   the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
   laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
   unavailability or interruption of operations.
   
   6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
   
   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
   ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
   INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
   WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
   DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
   HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
   
   7. GENERAL
   
   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
   the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
   action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
   
   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
   respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
   counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
   Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
   of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
   institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
   itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
   hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
   rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.
   
   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
   fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
   Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
   time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
   rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
   and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
   However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
   granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
   survive.
   
   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
   but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
   may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
   reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
   this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
   Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
   Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
   Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
   the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
   Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
   the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
   after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
   elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
   the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
   above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
   property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
   by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
   expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
   
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
   the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
   party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
   more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
   its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the Subject
Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from

other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
deemed to have been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any one
or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular functionality
or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's intel-
lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a description
of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon
gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
include the URL for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sec-
tions 2 and 3, above, and in the text of any related documentation, license
agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relat-
ing to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it
makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or news-
groups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject Soft-
ware that new knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY SER-

ORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIA-
BILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR
ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.
from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including
the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out of

Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to
the terms of this License.

subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
forceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as
possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the remainder
of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely

    SGI and any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
    license, under any Recipient Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
    offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
    and/or any Modifications provided by SGI.

    2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in
    Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of
    the algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any Modifications
    provided by SGI .

3. Redistributions.

    3.1. Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in
    Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and
    all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered
    Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can
    include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a
    copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral
    where the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.
    Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original
    Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions
    of Covered Code.

    3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with
    the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation
    of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the
    source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this
    License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such
    changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as
    licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's
    choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that
    the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
    and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
    terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other
    than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of
    its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient
    alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited
    license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
    accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such
    rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually
    been granted by SGI in this License.

    3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
    liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license
    terms Recipient offers.

4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to
cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code
that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License,
absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by
their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
shall survive.

5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
(i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark
or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right
for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the
Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title
to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with
SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this
License are reserved.

6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide
laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of
Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import
control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and
other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered
Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any
intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or
(ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have
been subject.

7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under
the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS
AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,

INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon
Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out
of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the
Covered Code or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12. U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item"
consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in

Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to
the terms of this License.

13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
concerning the its subject matter. If any provision of this License is held
to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as
nearly as possible the same legal and economic effect as the original
provision and the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This

of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,

fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

ansi2knr is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY.  No author or distributor accepts responsibility to anyone for the
consequences of using it or for whether it serves any particular purpose or
works at all, unless he says so in writing.  Refer to the GNU General Public
License (the "GPL") for full details.

Everyone is granted permission to copy, modify and redistribute ansi2knr,
but only under the conditions described in the GPL.  A copy of this license
is supposed to have been given to you along with ansi2knr so you can know
your rights and responsibilities.  It should be in a file named COPYLEFT.
[In the IJG distribution, the GPL appears below, not in a separate file.]
Among other things, the copyright notice and this notice must be preserved
on all copies.

We explicitly state here what we believe is already implied by the GPL: if
the ansi2knr program is distributed as a separate set of sources and a
separate executable file which are aggregated on a storage medium together
with another program, this in itself does not bring the other program under
the GPL, nor does the mere fact that such a program or the procedures for
constructing it invoke the ansi2knr executable bring any other part of the
program under the GPL.

---------- Here is the GNU GPL file COPYLEFT, referred to above ----------
----- These terms do NOT apply to the JPEG software itself; see README ------

		    GHOSTSCRIPT GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		    (Clarified 11 Feb 1988)

 Copyright (C) 1988 Richard M. Stallman
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license, but changing it is not allowed.  You can also use this wording
 to make the terms for other programs.

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share Ghostscript.  To make sure
that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of Ghostscript, that you receive source code or else can get
it if you want it, that you can change Ghostscript or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of Ghostscript, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for Ghostscript.  If Ghostscript is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

  Therefore we (Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation,
Inc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed
to distribute or change Ghostscript.


			COPYING POLICIES

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Ghostscript source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy a valid copyright and license
notice "Copyright (C) 1989 AlUsing </installer/core/miniroot/usr> as the package base directory.
## Processing package information.
## Processing system information.
   5 package pathnames are already properly installed.

Installing jpeg - The Independent JPEG Groups JPEG software as <SUNWjpg>

## Installing part 1 of 1.
addin Enterprises.  All rights reserved.
Distributed by Free Software Foundation, Inc." (or with whatever year is
appropriate); keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this
License Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Ghostscript program a copy of this License Agreement
along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee for the
physical act of transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of Ghostscript or any portion of
it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of
Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change; and

    b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of Ghostscript
    or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third
    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License
    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
    warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

Mere aggregation of another unrelated program with this program (or its
derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
the other program under the scope of these terms.

  3. You may copy and distribute Ghostscript (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

    a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal
    shipping charge) a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of
    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,

    c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the
    corresponding source code may be obtained.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form alone.)

For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for
all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include
source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the
operating system on which the executable file runs.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Ghostscript is
void and your rights to use the program under this License agreement
shall be automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received
computer software programs from you with this License Agreement will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of Ghostscript into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the Free
Software Foundation at 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.  We have not
yet worked out a simple rule that can be stated here, but we will often
permit this.  We will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software.

Your comments and suggestions about our licensing policies and our
software are welcome!  Please contact the Free Software Foundation,
Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, or call (617) 876-3296.

Introduction
============

  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
  FreeType Project.

  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      FreeType code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
  encourage you to use the following text:

   """
    Portions of this software are copyright  <year> The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
   """

  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
  actually use.


Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
  beta or final release.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
  engine'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
  specified below.

1. No Warranty
--------------

  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
      files.

    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

3. Advertising
--------------

  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
  purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
  of this license.

4. Contacts
-----------

  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

    o freetype@nongnu.org

      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

(f) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any Software
updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or
supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a separate
license.

(g) Software is copyrighted.

(h) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun
and its licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for
such uses.

(i) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark,
logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this
Agreement.

(j) If your Permitted Use in this Agreement permits the distribution
Software or portions of the Software, you may only distribute the Software
subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with
the terms contained in this Agreement.

4. Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination.

The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become,
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1,
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

8. Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you,
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
applicable to you.

9. Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

11. Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law
and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any
jurisdiction will apply.

12. Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an
authorized representative of each party.

For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice other
than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead, Sun elects to
use only the General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) at this time
for any software where a choice of GPL license versions is made
available with the language indicating that GPLv2 or any later
version may be used, or where a choice of which version of the GPL
is applied is otherwise unspecified.
====================================================================

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.



MySQL FLOSS License Exception

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
"FLOSS Exception").

Version 0.6, 7 March 2007

Exception Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (the ``GPL'').

Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
of the GPL:

 1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
    listed below in section 1, as long as:
      a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and
         separate works in themselves,
      b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
         are not derived from the Program, and which can
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works
         in themselves,
           i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
              listed below, and
          ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding
              machine-readable source code for those sections on
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of
              those sections, and
      c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
         considered independent and separate works in themselves
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
    MySQL AB.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third-party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY
 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.



MySQL FLOSS License Exception

The MySQL AB Exception for Free/Libre and Open Source
Software-only Applications Using MySQL Client Libraries (the
"FLOSS Exception").

Version 0.6, 7 March 2007

Exception Intent

We want specified Free/Libre and Open Source Software (``FLOSS'')
applications to be able to use specified GPL-licensed MySQL client
libraries (the ``Program'') despite the fact that not all FLOSS
licenses are compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (the ``GPL'').

Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of version 2.0
of the GPL:

 1. You are free to distribute a Derivative Work that is formed
    entirely from the Program and one or more works (each, a
    "FLOSS Work") licensed under one or more of the licenses
    listed below in section 1, as long as:
      a. You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and the
         Derivative Work, except for identifiable sections of the
         Derivative Work which are not derived from the Program,
         and which can reasonably be considered independent and
         separate works in themselves,
      b. all identifiable sections of the Derivative Work which
         are not derived from the Program, and which can
         reasonably be considered independent and separate works
         in themselves,
           i. are distributed subject to one of the FLOSS licenses
              listed below, and
          ii. the object code or executable form of those sections
              are accompanied by the complete corresponding
              machine-readable source code for those sections on
              the same medium and under the same FLOSS license as
              the corresponding object code or executable forms of
              those sections, and
      c. any works which are aggregated with the Program or with a
         Derivative Work on a volume of a storage or distribution
         medium in accordance with the GPL, can reasonably be
         considered independent and separate works in themselves
         which are not derivatives of either the Program, a
         Derivative Work or a FLOSS Work.
    If the above conditions are not met, then the Program may only
    be copied, modified, distributed or used under the terms and
    conditions of the GPL or another valid licensing option from
    MySQL AB.

    Exception. If you create or distribute a work which is a
    Derivative Work of both the Program and any other work

liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination. 

The Agreement is effective on the Date you recieve the Software and 
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's

state.

USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you.

11. Governing Law.

    Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

12. Severability.

    If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration.

    This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.

                        Copyright 2007 by Apple Inc.

			  Cupertino, CA 95014 USA

                         WWW: http://www.cups.org/


INTRODUCTION

The Common UNIX Printing System(tm), ("CUPS(tm)"), is provided
under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") and GNU Library
General Public License ("LGPL"), Version 2, with exceptions for
Apple operating systems and the OpenSSL toolkit. A copy of the
exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.

The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
located in the "cups" and "filter" subdirectories of the CUPS
source distribution and in the "cups" include directory and
library files in the binary distributions. The GNU GPL applies to
the remainder of the CUPS distribution, including the "pdftops"
filter which is based upon Xpdf.

For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
allows you to:

   - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
     binary form.
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
     sell support for the software.

What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions
to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or
LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions
of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system
license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.

The GNU LGPL relaxes the "link-to" restriction, allowing you to
develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your
application, driver, or filter.


LICENSE EXCEPTIONS

In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Apple Inc. grants
the following special exceptions:

     1. Apple Operating System Development License Exception;

	a. Software that is developed by any person or entity
	   for an Apple Operating System ("Apple OS-Developed
	   Software"), including but not limited to Apple and
	   third party printer drivers, filters, and backends
	   for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the
	   CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters
	   or backends provided with CUPS shall not be
	   considered to be a derivative work or collective work
	   based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the
	   mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL.
	   You may therefore distribute linked combinations of
	   the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed
	   Software without releasing the source code of the
	   Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample
	   filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop
	   Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the
	   source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software.

	b. An Apple Operating System means any operating system
	   software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer,
	   Inc., including but not limited to all existing
	   releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X,
	   and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on
	   releases and future versions thereof.

	c. This exception is only available for Apple
	   OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software
	   that is distributed for use on other operating
	   systems.

	d. All CUPS software that falls under this license
	   exception have the following text at the top of each
	   source file:

	     This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed
	     Software exception.

     2. OpenSSL Toolkit License Exception;

	a. Apple Inc. explicitly allows the compilation and
	   distribution of the CUPS software with the OpenSSL
	   Toolkit.

No developer is required to provide these exceptions in a
derived work.


KERBEROS SUPPORT CODE

The Kerberos support code ("KSC") is copyright 2006 by Jelmer
Vernooij and is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.  In no event will the author or Apple Inc. be held
liable for any damages arising from the use of the KSC.

Sources files containing KSC have the following text at the top
of each source file:

     This file contains Kerberos support code, copyright 2006 by
     Jelmer Vernooij.

The KSC copyright and license apply only to Kerberos-related
feature code in CUPS.  Such code is typically conditionally
compiled based on the present of the HAVE_GSSAPI preprocessor
definition.

Permission is granted to anyone to use the KSC for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and
redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

     1. The origin of the KSC must not be misrepresented; you
	must not claim that you wrote the original software. If
	you use the KSC in a product, an acknowledgment in the
	product documentation would be appreciated but is not
	required.

     2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such,
	and must not be misrepresented as being the original
	software.

     3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source
	distribution. 


TRADEMARKS

Apple Inc. has trademarked the Common UNIX Printing System, CUPS,
and CUPS logo. You may use these names and logos in any direct port
or binary distribution of CUPS. Please contact Apple Inc. for written
permission to use them in derivative products. Our intention is to
protect the value of these trademarks and ensure that any derivative
product meets the same high-quality standards as the original.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			 Version 2, June 1991

	  Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
   numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

			       Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

     Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing

Installing SQLite3 as <SUNWsqlite3>

## Installing part 1 of 1.
SQLite is in the Public Domain

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public
domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the
companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their
contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed
affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone
is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the
original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled
binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those
parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a
larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as
part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The details
here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the
documentation and build code so much because none of these things are
part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No
code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every
line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those
authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base
is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
Obtaining An Explicit License To Use SQLite

Even though SQLite is in the public domain and does not require a
license, some users want to obtain a license anyway. Some reasons for
obtaining a license include:

    * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the
      public domain.
    * You are using SQLite in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the
      right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
    * You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you
      have the legal right to use and distribute SQLite.
    * Your legal department tells you that you have to purchase a
      license.

If you feel like you really have to purchase a license for SQLite,
Hwaci, the company that employs the architect and principal developers
of SQLite, will sell you one.  Contributed Code

In order to keep SQLite completely free and unencumbered by copyright,
all new contributors to the SQLite code base are asked to dedicate their
contributions to the public domain. If you want to send a patch or
enhancement for possible inclusion in the SQLite source tree, please
accompany the patch with the following statement:

The author or authors of this code dedicate any and all copyright
interest in this code to the public domain. We make this dedication for
the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this
code under copyright law. 

We are not able to accept patches or changes to SQLite that are not
accompanied by a statement such as the above. In addition, if you make
changes or enhancements as an employee, then a simple statement such as
the above is insufficient. You must also send by surface mail a
copyright release signed by a company officer. A signed original of the
copyright release should be mailed to:

    Hwaci
    6200 Maple Cove Lane
    Charlotte, NC 28269
    USA 

A template copyright release is available in PDF or HTML. You can use
this release to make future changes.  This page last modified 2007/11/14
